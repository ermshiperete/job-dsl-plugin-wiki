Welcome to the jenkins-job-dsl wiki!

Highly recommended starting point is the tutorial, [[Tutorial: Using the Jenkins Job DSL]] 

Once you know how to create a "seed" job from the tutorial, start looking at the [[Real World Examples]] for examples to steal from.  For formal documentation, the [[Job DSL Commands]] page has what is available directly in the DSL at this time.

If you want to get fancy you'll want to read up on the _configure_ block which gives you direct access to the config.xml, read [[configure block]].

And finally, if you want to get more involved, [[here's how... | Contributing to the job dsl plugin Project]]

## Project Developer Docs
_Not required for users of the DSL. And like any developer docs, they're probably out of date the moment they're written._
