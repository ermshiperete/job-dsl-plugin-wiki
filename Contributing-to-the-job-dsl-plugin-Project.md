We are always happy for folks to help us out on this project.  Here's the ways you can help us out:

* Documentation
    * Small Changes - fixes to spelling, inaccuracies, errors - Just do it
    * Larger Changes - Whole new sections / pages - send a mail to the group with your proposal at https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/job-dsl-plugin
* New Features
    * Feature Requests - Send a mail to the group with your request at https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/job-dsl-plugin - if you can include an example snippet of the config.xml so much the better. 
    * Even better than this is an "New Feature" issue on the [[Jenkins JIRA|https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/secure/Dashboard.jspa]]. Remember and add the "job-dsl-plugin" component
    * Feature Implementations - Even better than both of these is an implementation.  Simply fork our repo, create a branch (named after the JIRA "New Feature" you created earlier), implement it yourself and submit a Pull Request.  Get started with the (light touch) [[Architecture Docs|Jenkins Job DSL Architecture]] and  [["How to Build"|Building the Jenkins Job DSL]] notes
* Bugs
    * Bug Reports - Send a mail to the group with your request at https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/job-dsl-plugin - The more information the better
    * Even better than this is a new "Bug" issue on the [[Jenkins JIRA|https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/secure/Dashboard.jspa]]. Remember and add the "job-dsl-plugin" component
    * Bug Fixes - Even better than both of these is a fix.   Simply fork our repo, create a branch (named after the JIRA "Bug" you created earlier), implement it yourself and submit a Pull Request.
