We are always happy for folks to help us out on this project.  Here's the ways you can help us out:

* Documentation
* * Small Changes - fixes to spelling, inaccuracies, errors - Just do it
* * Larger Changes - Whole new sections / pages - send a mail to the group with your proposal at https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/job-dsl-plugin
* Feature Requests - Send a mail to the group with your request at https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/job-dsl-plugin - if you can include an example snippet of the config.xml so much the better
* Feature Implementations - Even better than a Feature Request, implement it yourself and submit a Pull Request
* Bug Reports - Send a mail to the group with your request at https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/job-dsl-plugin - The more information the better
* Bug Fixes - Even better than a Bug Report, implement it yourself and submit a Pull Request
