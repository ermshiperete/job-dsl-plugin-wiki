We are always happy for folks to help us out on this project.  Here's the ways you can help us out:

* Documentation
    * Small Changes - fixes to spelling, inaccuracies, errors - Just do it
    * Larger Changes - Whole new sections / pages - send a mail to the group with your proposal at https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/job-dsl-plugin
* New Features
    * Feature Requests - Send a mail to the group with your request at https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/job-dsl-plugin - if you can include an example snippet of the config.xml so much the better
    * Feature Implementations - Even better than a Feature Request, implement it yourself and submit a Pull Request.  Get started with the (light touch) Architecture Docs [[Jenkins Job DSL Architecture]] and How to build [[Building the Jenkins Job DSL]] notes
* Bugs
    * Bug Reports - Send a mail to the group with your request at https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/job-dsl-plugin - The more information the better
    * Bug Fixes - Even better than a Bug Report, implement it yourself and submit a Pull Request

## Project Developer Docs
_Not required for users of the DSL. And like any developer docs, they're probably out of date the moment they're written._
