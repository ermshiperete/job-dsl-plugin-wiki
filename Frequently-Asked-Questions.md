Not all of these have been asked a lot, but they're good things to know.

1. **Q: Is there a Java Binding for Job-DSL?** - _A:_ No, not at the moment. The DSL relies heavily of both closures for contexts  and methodMissing/propertyMissing for XML generation. There's not currently a good Java equivalent of either of those. It's not to say that it couldn't be done, it'd just be ugly.
1. **Q: Why won't my DSL script run? - using an element name already defined in an outer scope** - _A:_ a common problem that many folks see using is "name()" in a configure block because this clashes with the name method of the job element. In general, you cannot use any element name (in this case "name") which is already an identifier in an outer scope. In these cases, you need to fallback to low-level API.
